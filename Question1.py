# Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you
# might choose one over the other.

# Answer - 

# Ordinal Encoding:
# Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or ranking among its categories.

# Label Encoding:
# Label encoding is used when the categorical data has no intrinsic order, and categories are treated as nominal or unordered.

# When to Choose One Over the Other:

# Choose Ordinal Encoding when:
# The categorical variable has a clear order or hierarchy.
# The order of categories conveys meaningful information for the problem (e.g., "low," "medium," "high" risk).
# Choose Label Encoding when:
# The categorical variable represents nominal data with no inherent order.
# The order of categories doesn't convey any meaningful information for the problem (e.g., "red," "green," "blue" for color categories).
